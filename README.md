# Fingerprint Matching README

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Fingerprint Matching** project! This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of fingerprint matching algorithms. The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust framework for the comparison and matching of fingerprint data using advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically homomorphic encryption.

## Features

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Leverages the OpenFHE library to perform secure computations on encrypted data.
- **Biometric Standards**: Complies with standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- **Image Processing**: Includes utilities for image compression and decompression using various algorithms.
- **Parallel Processing**: Supports parallel search and processing to enhance performance.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- **CMake**: Build system generator (version 3.10 or later).
- **OpenFHE Library**: For homomorphic encryption operations.
- **Standard Libraries**: Standard libraries for image processing and mathematical computations.

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/n7koirala/fingerprint_matching.git
    cd fingerprint_matching
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed:
    - OpenFHE
    - CMake
    - Standard C++ libraries

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the fingerprint matching application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./build/fingerprint_matching [fingerprint file 1.xyt] [fingerprint file 2.xyt]
```

For instance, try:
```bash
./fingerprint_matching ../test/6.xyt ../test/6.xyt
```


This will execute the main application, showcasing the fingerprint matching operations including encryption, matching, and decryption steps.


### Generating .xyt files
Look at `README.md` in the `tools` directory for more details.

## Configuration

### Parameters

The application can be configured using various parameters defined in the source code. Key parameters include:

- **Multiplicative Depth**: Set the depth of multiplicative operations.
- **Scaling Mod Size**: Configure the size for scaling modulus.
- **Batch Size**: Determine the batch size for encoding parameters.

### Example Configuration

```cpp
CCParams<CryptoContextCKKSRNS> parameters;
parameters.SetMultiplicativeDepth(15);
parameters.SetScalingModSize(45);
parameters.SetBatchSize(32768);
```
